Got it 👍 — You’ve shared a **Dockerfile**. Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### 📄 Dockerfile Explanation

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
```

* **Base Image**

  * This tells Docker to use the **official Python 3.9 image** as the starting point.
  * It already includes Python 3.9 installed, so you don’t have to install it manually.

---

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

* **Working Directory**

  * Sets the default working directory inside the container to `/app`.
  * Any command you run afterward (like `COPY`, `RUN`, or `CMD`) will happen relative to `/app`.

---

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .
```

* **Copy requirements**

  * Copies the `requirements.txt` file from your local machine into the container’s `/app` directory.
  * The `.` means "copy to current working directory" (which is `/app` because of `WORKDIR`).

---

```dockerfile
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* **Install dependencies**

  * Runs `pip install` inside the container to install all Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

---

```dockerfile
COPY . .
```

* **Copy application code**

  * Copies all files from your current local directory (where the Dockerfile is) into `/app` inside the container.
  * This ensures your app code is available in the container.

---

```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

* **Default Command**

  * Defines what runs by default when you start the container.
  * Here it launches `app.py` using Python.
  * Example: If you run

    ```bash
    docker run myapp
    ```

    it will execute:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

### 🔄 Flow Summary

1. Start from Python 3.9 image.
2. Set `/app` as working directory.
3. Copy and install Python dependencies.
4. Copy your entire project into the container.
5. Run your app with `python app.py` when the container starts.
