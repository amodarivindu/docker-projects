Perfect 👍 You have a **docker-compose.yml** file here. Let’s go through two things:

1. **How to execute it** (run it).
2. **What each line of code does** (code-level explanation).

# ⚡ 1. How to execute this `docker-compose.yml`

Assume your project folder looks like this:

```
project/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Dockerfile
└── docker-compose.yml
```

👉 Steps:

### Step 1: Move into project folder

```bash
cd path/to/project
```

### Step 2: Start containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

* `up` → starts the services defined in the file.
* `--build` → builds your Flask app image (from `Dockerfile`) before starting.

### Step 3: Test the app

Open browser → [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

* This should reach your **Flask app** (inside `web` container).
* The app connects to Postgres (`db`) container.

### Step 4: Stop containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This removes containers but keeps images/volumes.

# 🧩 2. Code-level explanation of `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'
```

* Docker Compose **file format version**.
* `3.8` works with modern Docker versions.

---

```yaml
services:
```

* Defines the **containers** (services) that Docker Compose will manage.
* Here: `web` (Flask app) + `db` (Postgres).

---

### 🚀 Web service

```yaml
 web:
  build: .
  ports:
  - "5000:5000"
  depends_on:
  - db
```

* **`web:`** → service name (container will be called `project_web`).
* **`build: .`** → build the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in current directory (`.`).
* **`ports:`** → maps container port `5000` → host port `5000`.

  * So you can access Flask at `http://localhost:5000`.
* **`depends_on:`** → ensures `db` container starts before `web`.

---

### 🗄 DB service

```yaml
 db:
  image: postgres
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    POSTGRES_DB: mydb
```

* **`db:`** → service name (container will be called `project_db`).
* **`image: postgres`** → use official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub.
* **`environment:`** → set environment variables for Postgres:

  * `POSTGRES_USER=user` → database username = `user`.
  * `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password` → password = `password`.
  * `POSTGRES_DB=mydb` → create a database named `mydb`.

---

# 🔗 Networking between containers

* Docker Compose creates a **default network** where each service can talk to others using the **service name** as hostname.
* That’s why in your Flask app you wrote:

  ```python
  psycopg2.connect(host="db", dbname="mydb", user="user", password="password")
  ```

  * `db` → automatically resolves to Postgres container’s IP.
  * No need to use `localhost` inside container.

---

✅ So in summary:

* `db` runs Postgres database.
* `web` runs Flask app, connects to Postgres using `host="db"`.
* Ports are mapped so you can reach Flask at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

👉 Do you want me to also give you the **exact commands to enter the Postgres container** and run SQL queries inside `mydb`?
